## Verifying contracts

`forge verify-contract 0x34b3e90114373B996021f033c6902e929cD174fa AuditRegistry --verifier-url 'https://api.routescan.io/v2/network/testnet/evm/43113/etherscan' --etherscan-api-key "verifyContract" --constructor-args $(cast abi-encode "constructor(address,address)" 0x6A2313CAa56945AcC32DB08157e6a79D4986904C 0x3e770515D6Ed2197817dF6eeB26853df4E739080) --watch`

## Installing Dependencies

Foundry typically uses git submodules to manage dependencies, but this template uses Node.js packages because
[submodules don't scale](https://twitter.com/PaulRBerg/status/1736695487057531328).

This is how to install dependencies:

1. Install the dependency using your preferred package manager, e.g. `bun install dependency-name`
   - Use this syntax to install from GitHub: `bun install github:username/repo-name`
2. Add a remapping for the dependency in [remappings.txt](./remappings.txt), e.g.
   `dependency-name=node_modules/dependency-name`

Note that OpenZeppelin Contracts is pre-installed, so you can follow that as an example.

## Writing Tests

To write a new test contract, you start by importing `Test` from `forge-std`, and then you inherit it in your test
contract. Forge Std comes with a pre-instantiated [cheatcodes](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cheatcodes/) environment
accessible via the `vm` property. If you would like to view the logs in the terminal output, you can add the `-vvv` flag
and use [console.log](https://book.getfoundry.sh/faq?highlight=console.log#how-do-i-use-consolelog).

This template comes with an example test contract [Foo.t.sol](./test/Foo.t.sol)

## Usage

This is a list of the most frequently needed commands.

### Build

Build the contracts:

```sh
$ forge build
```

### Clean

Delete the build artifacts and cache directories:

```sh
$ forge clean
```

### Compile

Compile the contracts:

```sh
$ forge build
```

### Coverage

Get a test coverage report:

```sh
$ forge coverage
```

### Deploy

Deploy to Anvil:

```sh
$ forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --broadcast --fork-url http://localhost:8545
```

For this script to work, you need to have a `MNEMONIC` environment variable set to a valid
[BIP39 mnemonic](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/).

For instructions on how to deploy to a testnet or mainnet, check out the
[Solidity Scripting](https://book.getfoundry.sh/tutorials/solidity-scripting.html) tutorial.

### Format

Format the contracts:

```sh
$ forge fmt
```

### Gas Usage

Get a gas report:

```sh
$ forge test --gas-report
```

### Lint

Lint the contracts:

```sh
$ bun run lint
```

### Test

Run the tests:

```sh
$ forge test
```

Generate test coverage and output result to the terminal:

```sh
$ bun run test:coverage
```

Generate test coverage with lcov report (you'll have to open the `./coverage/index.html` file in your browser, to do so
simply copy paste the path):

```sh
$ bun run test:coverage:report
```
