The AI auditor service will aim to audit smart contracts and return a security score based on how secure the contract is.

The architecture was greatly inspired by the solution from the paper: [Large Language Model-Powered Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection: New Perspectives](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01152), where an adversarial model is proposed, playing the roles of an AUDITOR and a CRITIC. In our case the goal is to replace the CRITIC agent with real-life security experts by gamefying the process of providing feedback and improving data quality.
